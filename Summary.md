#### After evaluating the out of sample data I calculated a Root Mean Squared Error of 0.41254 and after analyzing the in sample performance I calcualted a Root Mean Squared Error of 0.59667. Since the Root Mean Squared Error was lower for out of sample data we can conclude that the model works better with new data.

### Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?
#### Yes, based on my time series analysis I would buy Yen as a long term investment because we can see that in 2020 it is undervalued compared to its high points in 1995 and 2012. Based on these trends we can see that the Yen will more than likely rise in the next decade. In the short term, buying Yen is still risky.

### Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?
####  The risk of Yen is expected to increase because of the increasing volatility.
### Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?
#### Based on the Models created I would not feel comfortable using them for trading because of the P values(p > 0.05) being too high on the Arma and Arima models. The Garch model may have a better P value but we cannot only rely on that for trading purposes.
